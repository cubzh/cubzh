        [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh) is a platform where you can quickly build games and distribute them on all platforms (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, web, Discord, and more).

        This documentation contains everything developers need to know to create Cubzh games. 👾

    - title: "Luau"

    - text: |
        [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh) scripts use the Luau programming language.

        [Luau](https://luau.org) is derived from [Lua](https://www.lua.org) (5.1) which is a very solid and lightweight scripting language that's been around since 1993. It's easy to learn and already used by other popular video game platforms like [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com).
    
        A default Lua script is generated when you create a new game. You can launch the game in edit mode and select "Edit code" in the pause menu to see it.

        Don't worry if you're not familiar with the language or even a complete code beginner. You'll get started building fun games in minutes. ☺️

        Client.OnStart = function()
            local ambience = require("ambience")
            ambience:set(ambience.noon)
            
            -- drop above center of map
            Player:SetParent(World)
            Player.Position = Map.Size * Map.Scale * {0.5, 1, 0.5}
        end

        Client.Action1 = function()
            if Player.IsOnGround then
                Player.Velocity.Y = 100 -- DEMO: changing this value
            end
        end

    - title: "Truly cross-platform"

    - text : |
        Isn't it better when everyone can play? 🙂

        [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh) runs on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, web browsers, Discord and even more platforms soon (Linux, Telegram, etc.).

        The scripting API is designed for developers to worry as little as possible about making sure their games work fine on each platform.

        Pointer events abstracting mouse and touch events as well as other platform agnostic action inputs are here to smooth things out. Thus not preventing you from writing code that would be platform specific.

        Games are definitely more fun with friends!

        One line of code, like `require("multi")`, and you're good to go! 
        <i style="color: #777;">(other open-source modules can offer real-time multiplayer synchronization too)</i>

        You don't need to worry about servers, Cubzh handles that for you, spawning game server instances on demand.

        We're just starting to scratch the surface of what's possible with generative AI, but Cubzh does intend to be the best gaming platform for it.

        Cubzh's scripting ecosystem is designed for natural integration with AI code generation systems.
