        Assuming the player's avatar has its default dimensions `kPlayerHeight`, `kPlayerHalfWidth` and `kPlayerHalfDepth`, this checks whether it is colliding with the given `shape` in the game's world:

    - code: |
        Client.OnStart = function()
            kPlayerHeight = 10.5 -- 2.1 map cubes
            kPlayerHalfWidth = 2.0
            kPlayerHalfDepth = 2.0
        end

        function collides(shape)
            local playerMin = Number3(
                Player.Position.X - kPlayerHalfWidth,
                Player.Position.Y,
                Player.Position.Z - kPlayerHalfDepth)
            local playerMax = Number3(
                Player.Position.X + kPlayerHalfWidth,
                Player.Position.Y + kPlayerHeight,
                Player.Position.Z + kPlayerHalfDepth)
            local halfSize = (
                shape.Width > shape.Depth
                and shape.Width * 0.5
                or shape.Depth * 0.5) * shape.LocalScale.X
            local shapeMin = Number3(
                shape.Position.X - halfSize,
                shape.Position.Y,
                shape.Position.Z - halfSize)
            local shapeMax = Number3(
                shape.Position.X + halfSize,
                shape.Position.Y + shape.Height * shape.LocalScale.X,
                shape.Position.Z + halfSize)
            if playerMax.X > shapeMin.X and
                playerMin.X < shapeMax.X and

        This code uses the [`Ray`](/reference/ray) and [`Impact`](/reference/impact) API objects:

    - code: |
        local impact = Player:CastRay()
        if impact ~= nil then
            print(impact.Object, impact.Distance)
        end
