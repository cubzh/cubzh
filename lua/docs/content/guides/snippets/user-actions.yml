        If you need to conditionally block the player's movement depending on some variable (for example, here, `blocked`):

    - code: |
        Client.DirectionalPad = function(x, y)
            -- storing globals here for AnalogPad
            -- to update Player.Motion
            dpadX = x 
            dpadY = y
            if not blocked then
                Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * y + Player.Right * x) * 50
            end
        end

        Client.AnalogPad = function(dx, dy)
            Player.LocalRotation.Y = Player.LocalRotation.Y + dx * 0.01
            Player.LocalRotation.X = Player.LocalRotation.X + -dy * 0.01

            if dpadX ~= nil and dpadY ~= nil then
                if not blocked then
                    Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * dpadY + Player.Right * dpadX) * 50
                end
            end
        end
