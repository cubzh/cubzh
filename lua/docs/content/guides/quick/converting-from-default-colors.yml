title: "Quick know-how > Converting from default colors (0.0.46 > 0.0.47)"

        Starting from the version 0.0.47, Cubzh uses custom colors instead of default references to a fixed palette. This is why recent scripts will define colors based on the [`Color`](/reference/color) object, rather than a simple integer reference.

        If you need to update one of your scripts to obey this new system, you have two solutions:

        1. quick and easy: just replace your reference by `DefaultColors[<your reference>]`
           
           For example:

    - code: |
        -- 0.0.46
        local BLUE = 181
        -- 0.0.47
        local BLUE = DefaultColors[181]

    - text: |
        2. custom and efficient: define the variable with a specific RGB(A) tint by using the `Color` API and passing it 3 (RGB) or 4 (RGBA) values
           
           For example:

    - code: |
        local BLUE = Color(76, 215, 255)
    
    - text: |
        As a reminder, here's the fixed palette that versions before 0.0.46 used:
