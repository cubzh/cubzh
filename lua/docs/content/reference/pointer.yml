    Pointer is a shortcut to [Client].[Pointer].
    
    Pointer allows to catch user pointer events (mouse events or touch events depending on the device).

    It's a useful abstraction allowing inputs to work on any platform (PC, mobile, web, etc.).

    It's a useful abstraction allowing inputs to work on any platform. (PC, mobile, web, etc.)

    Even if there's no such thing as a visual pointer on a touch screen, we do consider 2 modes: `pointer shown` and `pointer hidden`.

        Pointer allows to catch user pointer events. (mouse events or touch events depending on the device)

        It's a useful abstraction allowing inputs to work on any platform. (PC, mobile, web, etc.)

        ⚠️ Even if there's no such thing as a visual pointer on a touch screen, we do consider 2 modes: `pointer shown` and `pointer hidden`.

    - subtitle: "Pointer Shown"

    - text: |
        Switching to that mode when calling [Pointer:Show()](/reference/pointer#functions-show).

        When the pointer is "shown":

        [Pointer.Click](/reference/pointer#property-click), [Pointer.Down](/reference/pointer#property-down) and [Pointer.Up](/reference/pointer#property-up) functions are called on left clicks or one finger touches (when the action is not caught by a button or some other [LocalEvent] listener first).

        [Pointer.Drag](/reference/pointer#property-drag) is called when moving the mouse or finger between `down` and `up` events.

        [Pointer.Drag2](/reference/pointer#property-drag) is called when moving the mouse while pressing right click, or moving on a touch screen with 2 fingers down.

        [Pointer.Zoom](/reference/pointer#property-drag) is called scrolling with the mouse wheel or pinching in/out with 2 fingers.

        These actions are disabled: [Client.AnalogPad](/reference/client#property-analogpad), [Client.Action2](/reference/client#property-action2), [Client.Action2Release](/reference/client#property-action2release), [Client.Action3](/reference/client#property-action3), [Client.Action3Release](/reference/client#property-action3release)

        ([Client.DirectionalPad](/reference/client#property-directionalpad), [Client.Action1](/reference/client#property-action1) & [Client.Action1Release](/reference/client#property-action1release) remain available)

    - subtitle: "Pointer hidden"

    - text: |
        Switching to that mode when calling [Pointer:Hide()](/reference/pointer#functions-hide).

        When the pointer is "hidden":

        [Client.DirectionalPad](/reference/client#property-directionalpad) is called when activating directional keys (WASD keys on a QWERTY keyboard by default) or the directional pad on touch screens (available in both modes).

        [Client.AnalogPad](/reference/client#property-analogpad) is called when moving the mouse or moving on a touch screen with one finger down. It's often used to control the camera.

        All 3 action buttons are available: [Client.Action1](/reference/client#property-action1), [Client.Action1Release](/reference/client#property-action1release), [Client.Action2](/reference/client#property-action2), [Client.Action2Release](/reference/client#property-action2release), [Client.Action3](/reference/client#property-action3), [Client.Action3Release](/reference/client#property-action3release)
