        Events are useful to establish communication between the [Server] and all connected [Player]s. 

        Here's a simple example:

    - code: |
        local e = Event()
        e.someMessage = "Something I'd like to say!"
        e.someNumber = 42
        e:SendTo(Server) -- send to Server

        -- other possible recipients:
        e:SendTo(Players) -- send to all players
        e:SendTo(Players[2]) -- send to player 2
        e:SendTo(OtherPlayers) -- send to all players but self

    - text: |
        Events trigger the `DidReceiveEvent` function for each recipient (see [Client.DidReceiveEvent](/reference/client#property-didreceiveevent) & [Server.DidReceiveEvent](/reference/server#property-didreceiveevent)).

    - code: |
        Server.DidReceiveEvent = function(event)
          -- `action` here is a custom field set by the developer
          if event.action == "ping" then

            local response = Event()
            response.action = "pong"
            response:SendTo(event.Sender)

          end
        end
    
constructors: 
  - description: |
      Creates an empty event.

      Custom fields can then be set with [string], [number] and [boolean] values. (more value types will be supported soon)
    samples:
      - code: |
          local e = Event()
          e.someMessage = "Something I'd like to say!"
          e.someNumber = 42
          e:SendTo(OtherPlayers)
