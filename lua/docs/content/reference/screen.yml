    Screen represents the area on which the app is rendered.

    There are two screen sizes,
    - render size: the raw resolution of the render buffer, which scales with device properties and quality settings. Notably, higher quality settings will use higher render resolution.
    - points size: a fixed size that depends on device screen density. For this reason, this is generally used to create UI scenes that have a consistent look&feel accross devices.

    In Cubzh, orthographic cameras automatically use points scaling, while perspective cameras use render scaling. This may become an opt-in for coders in the future, instead of being automatic.
    As of version `0.1.1`, the only exception to that rule is if an orthographic camera is forced to render before a perspective camera with [This].[ViewOrder](#property-vieworder), in which case, the orthographic camera will use render scaling. This may be addressed in future updates.

    - name: "Density"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Screen's density. This is the factor used for points scaling accross Cubzh.
          
          You may use this value as a scaling factor for some UI elements, when their look&feel needs to be consistent accross devices. An example of that would be 9-slice scaling for [Quad](reference/quad) objects.
    - name: "SafeArea"
      type: "table"
      description: |
          Returns the margin on each side of the screen where, ideally, no UI element should be placed as they may overlap with some device features like a camera notch.

          It is a table of four values using the following keys: `Top`, `Bottom`, `Left`, `Right`

functions:
    - name: "DidResize"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when the Screen is resized. Passes the screen width and height in points as parameters.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Screen.DidResize = function(width, height)
              print("SCREEN SIZE:", width, height)
            end
    
    - name: "Capture"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Captures a screenshot, ignoring the app UI. It will open a file picker to select a file location on your device.

          You can optionally provide a default file name, and whether or not the background should be transparent.
      arguments:
        - name: "filename"
          type: "string"
          optional: true
        - name: "transparentBackground"
          type: "string"
          optional: true
