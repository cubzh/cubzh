type: "Number2"
description: A Number2 contains 3 [number] values (X & Y). It can represent different things in 2D space, like points or positions.

constructors: 
  - description: "Creates a Number2 with values x and y."
    arguments:
    - name: "x"
      type: "number"
    - name: "y"
      type: "number"
    samples:
      - code: |
          local myNumber2 = Number2(1, 2)

properties:
  - name: "Height"
    type: "number"
    description: "Same as Y property."
    
  - name: "Width"
    type: "number"
    description: "Same as X property."

  - name: "X"
    type: "number"
    description: "X value of the Number2."
    samples:
      - code: |
          myNumber2.X = 42
          print(myNumber2.X)

  - name: "Y"
    type: "number"
    description: "Y value of the Number2."
    samples:
      - code: |
          myNumber2.Y = 42
          print(myNumber2.Y)

  - name: "Length"
    type: "number"
    description: |
        Magnitude of the `Number2`.

  - name: "SquaredLength"
    type: "number"
    description: |
      Squared magnitude of the `Number2`.

functions:
  - name: "Copy"
    return: 
      - type: "Number2" 
    description: |
      Returns a copy of the [Number2].
    samples:
      - code: |
          local n1 = Number2(1, 0, 0)
          local n2 = n1 -- n2 is not a copy but a direct reference to n1
          n2.X = 10
          print(n1.X) -- now n1.X == 10

          -- using Copy:
          local n1 = Number2(1, 0, 0)
          local n2 = n1:Copy() -- n2 is a copy of n1, they're not the same Number2
          n2.X = 10
          print(n1.X) -- n1.X is still 1
  
  - name: "Normalize"
    description: |
      Normalizes the `Number2` so that its magnitude becomes `1.0`.
  
  - name: "Lerp"
    description: |
        Sets this `Number2` to the linear interpolation between two given `Number2` at a given ratio.

      - name: "to"
        type: "Number2"
      - name: "ratio"
        type: "number"
  
  - name: "Set"
    description: |
        Sets this `Number2`'s components to the given values.
    argument-sets:
