      An event that's generated when using the [Pointer]. (see [Pointer].[Down](/reference/pointer#property-down) or [Pointer].[Up](/reference/pointer#property-up))

        - type: "Impact" 
      description: |
          Casts a ray from [PointerEvent] screen coordinates and returns an [Impact] (can be [nil]).

          The [Impact] contains information about the kind of thing that's been hit.

          💡 Calls [Ray].[Cast](/reference/ray#functions-cast) under the hood. See [Ray].[Cast](/reference/ray#functions-cast) definition for more details about possible filters.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Pointer.Down = function( pointerEvent )
                local impact = pointerEvent:CastRay()
                if impact.Block ~= nil then
                  print("block hit:", impact.Block)
                end

                -- this can also be done using a Ray object:
                local ray = Ray(pointerEvent.Position, pointerEvent.Direction)
                impact = ray:Cast()
                if impact.Block ~= nil then
                  print("block hit:", impact.Block)
                end
            end
            
properties:
  - name: "X"
    type: "number"
    description: |
        Horizontal position of the pointer when the event happens, in screen coordinates. `{0,0}` represents the bottom left of the screen, and `{1,1}` the top right. `X` is close to `0.5` when pointing the horizontal center.

  - name: "Y"
    type: "number"
    description: |
        Vertical position of the pointer when the event happens, in screen coordinates. `{0,0}` represents the bottom left of the screen, and `{1,1}` the top right. `Y` is close to `0.5` when pointing the vertical center.

  - name: "DX"
    type: "number"
    description: |
        Horizontal delta, not `0` when moving the pointer (see [Pointer].[Drag](/reference/pointer#property-drag) or [Pointer].[Drag2](/reference/pointer#property-drag2))

  - name: "DY"
    type: "number"
    description: |
        Vertical delta, not `0` when moving the pointer (see [Pointer].[Drag](/reference/pointer#property-drag) or [Pointer].[Drag2](/reference/pointer#property-drag2))

  - name: "Position"
    type: "Number3"
    description: |
        The world space origin of the ray cast from the screen. This is equivalent to [Camera].[Position].

  - name: "Direction"
    type: "Number3"
    description: |
        The direction of the ray cast from screen space [PointerEvent].[X] and [PointerEvent].[Y] into world space.

  - name: "Down"
    type: "boolean"
    description: |
        Indicates whether the [This] represents a touch/click "down" event. If false, it represents a "up" event.
