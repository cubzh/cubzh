type: "Box"
description: |
    A Box represents a volume axis-aligned to a given space : it is defined with only two [Number3], a minimum and a maximum, which represent the extents of the box along the axes of that space.

    For example, a [Shape].[BoundingBox](/reference/shape#property-boundingbox) is axis-aligned to the model space of that shape, pertaining to its blocks.
    However, an [Object].[CollisionBox](/reference/object#property-collisionbox) is axis-aligned to the world space of the scene, like most physics-related boxes.

    When using or creating an axis-aligned Box, be mindful of what space it is relevant to.
constructors: 
  - description: "Creates a default Box with no volume, or with given minimum and maximum points."
    argument-sets:
      -
      -
        - name: "min"
          type: "Number3"
        - name: "max"
          type: "Number3"
    samples:
      - code: |
          -- creates a box with both min & max = {0,0,0}
          local box = Box()

          box = Box({0,0,0}, {10,10,10})

properties:
  - name: "Min"
    type: "Number3"
    description: |
        [This] minimum point representing the lower extent along the axes.

  - name: "Max"
    type: "Number3"
    description: |
        [This] maximum point representing the upper extent along the axes.

  - name: "Size"
    type: "Number3"
    description: |
        Size of the box from its minimum point. This automatically sets [This].[Max](/reference/box#property-max).

  - name: "Center"
    type: "Number3"
    read-only: true
    description: |
        [This] geometric center point.
    
functions:
  - name: "Copy"
    return:
        - type: "Box"
    description: |
        Returns a copy of the [Box].

  - name: "Fit"
    arguments:
      - name: "target"
        type: "Object"
      - name: "config"
        type: "table"
        optional: true
    description: |
        Sets the box to a bounding box fitting the given target's model.

        Config table can contain any of the following: `{ recursive=boolean, local=boolean }`,
        - `recursive`: if `true, `the box will also fit all of target's descendants models. Default is `false`.
        - `local`: if `true`, result box will be in target's local space. Default is `false`, returning a box in world space.

  - name: "Merge"
    arguments:
      - name: "b"
        type: "Box"
    description: |
        Sets the box to the combination of both boxes.
  
  - name: "Cast"
    arguments:
      - name: "direction"
        type: "Number3"
      - name: "maxDistance"
        type: "number"
        optional: true
      - name: "filterIn"
        type: "CollisionGroups"
        optional: true
      - name: "filterOut"
        type: "Object"
        optional: true
    return:
        - type: "Impact"
    description: |
        Cast the [Box] along the given direction vector until max distance is reached, if provided.

        The box will collide with any objects matching the `filterIn` collision groups. If `nil` is provided, the ray collides with all [CollisionGroups] by default.

        Additionally, an object can be provided as `filterOut` to exclude it as a potential result. However, it is generally a best practice to filter using collision groups.
