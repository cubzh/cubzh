description: |
  A [Shape] is an [Object] that carries a voxel model made of [Block]s.

  It introduces an additionnal coordinate system called model space i.e. relative to model origin.
  Any point can be expressed in model space. If the point is expressed with integers, then it may represent a [Block] coordinates.

  Note that under certain conditions, namely if the [This],
  - is not mutable or is mutable but its model has not been changed,
  - has a pivot set to zero,
  then model space and local space become equivalent.

constructors: 
  - description: |
        Creates a Shape which model can be empty, loaded from an imported [Item], or copied from an existing [Shape] or [MutableShape].
    argument-sets:
      -
        
      -
        - name: "item"
          type: "Item"
      -
        - name: "copiedShape"
          type: "Shape"
      -
        - name: "copiedMutableShape"
          type: "MutableShape"
      -
    samples:
      - code: |
          local myShape = Shape(Items.someuser.someitem)
          myShape.Position = { Map.Width * 0.5, Map.Height, Map.Depth * 0.5 }
          Map:AddChild(myShape) -- adds created shape in the map

properties:

    - name: "Pivot"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          [This]'s pivot is a local point that acts as a reference for its transformations:
          - translation is applied from its parent's pivot to its own pivot
          - rotation is applied around the pivot

          It is set by default to [This]'s geometric center.

          You can override it with any point, even outside of the [This]'s bounding box, as a way to modify how transformations are applied.
          Note that setting the pivot to zero effectively means you are using the [This]'s model origin as reference point for transformations.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- set it to any arbitrary point
            myShape.Pivot = { 2.3, 5.0, 1.5 }
            -- set it to a specific block, it will use block's center (*)
            myShape.Pivot = myShape:GetBlock(1, 1, 1)
            -- doing this resets pivot to its default value (*)
            myShape.Pivot = { myShape.Width * 0.5, myShape.Height * 0.5, myShape.Depth * 0.5 }
            -- (*) both these use-cases are valid only if myShape is not mutable or is mutable but has not been changed,
            -- otherwise, it is still possible: pivot must first be set to zero, then convert with myShape:BlockToLocal

      description: |

      description: |
          Whether or not the [This] should ignore scene lighting, `false` by default.

functions:
    - name: "GetBlock"
      description: |
          Gets a [Block] from the [Shape].
          Returned [Block] is read-only because [Shape] is immutable, unlike [MutableShape].
          Returns [nil] if there is no [Block] at those coordinates (i. e. if it's "air").

    - name: "ComputeBakedLight"
      description: |
        Computes the shape baked lighting. Note that if the shape is then saved, the current baked lighting will be saved with it and used everywhere by default.
        
        This function can also be used to update the shape baked lighting, after changing by code some of the shape's [Palette] entries properties.
        
        You may want to call this function only if:
        - setting light property i.e. `shape.Palette[i].Light = true/false` of existing shape blocks
        - setting transparency i.e. `shape.Palette[i].Color.A = newValue` of existing shape blocks
        
        It is NOT necessary to call this function if:
        - ANY blocks, including light and transparent blocks, are added/removed at runtime
        
        In other words, only changes to transparency and light properties of _existing_ blocks will require a call to this function in order to see the effects on the shape.
        
        NOTE as of 0.0.47: only the [Map] can have baked lighting.
