type: "CollisionGroups"

description: |
    `CollisionGroups` represents an [array] of collision group numbers between `1` and `12`.

    Collision groups are used to define how objects in the world collide with each others.
    
    By default, the [Map] is in group `1`, [Player]s in group `2` any other objects in group `3` ; players and objects collide with other objects and the map. This behavior can be changed by setting different collision groups.

constructors:
  - description: |
      Creates an empty [CollisionGroups].

  - description: |
      Creates a [CollisionGroups] with given group numbers.
    arguments:
    - name: "group1"
      type: "number"
    - name: "group2"
      type: "number"
    - name: "..."
      type: "number"
    samples:
      - code: |
          local groups1 = CollisionGroups(1, 2, 3)
          local groups2 = CollisionGroups(2, 3, 1)
          if groups1 == groups2 then
            print("both groups are the same")
          end
