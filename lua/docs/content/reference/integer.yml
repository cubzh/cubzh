        Integers are numbers with no fractional part. A [number] can be considered as an [integer] as soon as it does not have the period decimal separator.

  - code: |
        local a = 10 -- integer (can also be considered as a number)
        local b = 10.5 -- number only 
        local c = 10.0 -- number only, even if the fractional part is equal to 0

  - text: |
        You can convert numbers with a fractional part equal to 0 into integers by using the standard function `math.tointeger`.

  - code: |
        local a = math.tointeger(10) -- 10, conversion successful
        local b1 = math.tointeger(10.5) -- nil, conversion fails
        local b2 = math.tointeger(math.floor(10.5 + 0.5)) -- 11, converted from 11.0
        local c = math.tointeger(10.0) -- 10, conversion successful
