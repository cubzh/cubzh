type: "Object"
description: |
  An `Object` is the most basic thing that can be added to the game 3D scene.

  It has a position, a rotation and a scale and can contain child [Object]s, including [Object] extensions like [Shape].

  An object by itself does not render anything on screen, but it can contain [Shape]s and thus become a parent coordinate system for them.

  An `Object` can also take part in the physics simulation when setting [Object.Physics](#property-physics) to `true`.

constructors:
  - description: "Creates an Object."
    samples:
      - code: |
          local o = Object()
          World:AddChild(o) -- adds o to the [World] (top level object in the game scene)

properties:

    - name: "Acceleration"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          [This]'s constant acceleration in world coordinates per second squared.

          ⚠️ `Acceleration` will only affect [This]'s position while [This].[Physics](#property-physics) is `true`.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- Acceleration can be used to compensate gravity: 
            myObject.Acceleration = -Config.ConstantAcceleration
            -- myObject's acceleration is now the invert of 
            -- Config.ConstantAcceleration, cancelling it.

    - name: "CollisionGroups"
      type: "CollisionGroups"
      description: |
          Collision groups the [This] belongs to. 

          ⚠️ It doesn't mean the [This] will collide with other [Object]s in these groups. 

          If the [This] belongs to group number `3` for example, it means all [Object]s that have group number `3` in their [Object].[CollidesWithGroups](#property-collideswithgroups) property will collide with it.

          By default:
          - [Object]s collide with the [Map] and other [Object]s
          - [Player]s collide with the [Map] only

          That can all be configured differently depening on your needs.

    - name: "OnCollision"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          [nil] by default. Can be set to a function that will be triggered when the [This] collides with another [Object].

          The function is called with 3 parameters: the object the callback was set for, the other actor in the collision and the [Face] of the first actor that's in contact.

          Note: it's not necessary to do use all 3 parameters.
      samples:
        - code: |
            object.OnCollision = function(o1, o2)
              -- `o1` is `object` here

          [nil] by default. Can be set to a function that will be triggered when the [This] ends colliding with another [Object].

          The function is called with 2 parameters: the object the callback was set for and the other actor in the collision. 
      samples:

      description: |
          Executed when the [Pointer] is dragged (moved while down). Receives a [PointerEvent] parameter, just like [Pointer.Drag](/reference/pointer#property-drag).

          ([nil] by default)
      samples:

    - name: "Position"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |

      read-only: true
      description: |
          `true` when the [This] is not falling.

          ⚠️ `IsOnGround` only makes sense when [This].Physics is `true`.

    - name: "IsHidden"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Can be set to `true` for the [This] to be hidden recursively, meaning [This] and all of its children are hidden.

          Nothing else changes, the [This] remains in the scene and it keeps being affected by the simulation (collisions, etc.).

    - name: "IsHiddenSelf"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Can be set to `true` for the [This] to be hidden individually.

    - name: "LocalPosition"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Local position of the [This] relative to its parent.

          All of [This]'s ancestors local transformations are combined to obtain the [This] "world position" ([Object.Position](#property-position)), the [Object]'s final position.

    - name: "Rotation"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Rotation of the [This] in the world (as seen on screen).

          While it usually works for simple operations (like `Rotation.X = Rotation.X + someAngle`), we advise you to use [Number3].[Rotate](/reference/number3#functions-rotate) to rotate an object around X, Y & Z axis.

          You can also set unit vectors like [This].[Up](#property-up), [This].[Right](#property-right) or [This].[Forward](#property-forward) to orient your object.
      samples:
        - code: |
            local o = Object()
            o.Rotation = {0, math.pi, 0}
            -- o revolved half a turn on Y axis

            -- another way to rotate the object:
            o.Forward:Rotate({0, 0, math.pi / 2})
            o.Forward = Camera.Forward

    - name: "Tick"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Tick is a [function] executed ~30 times per second when set ([nil] by default). Provides the [This] and elapsed time in seconds as parameters.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- executed ~30 times per second on each user device
            myObject.Tick = function(object, dt)
              print("elapsed:", dt, "seconds")
            end

    - name: "LocalRotation"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Local rotation of the [This] relative to its parent.

          All of [This]'s ancestors local transformations are combined to obtain the "world rotation" ([Object.Rotation](#property-rotation)), the [Object]'s final rotation.
    
    - name: "Velocity"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Velocity of the [This] in world coordinates per second.

          ⚠️ `Velocity` will only affect [This]'s position while [This].[Physics](#property-physics) is `true`. Whenever it is set to `false`, `Velocity` is set to `{0,0,0}`.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- makes myObject jump:
            myObject.Velocity.Y = 100

    - name: "Motion"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          Be aware, this `Motion` property is a hack regarding laws of physics. (sorry Isaac)

          But it's very practical to move objects without worrying about forces at play.

          This is what's being used by default when you're moving around with your avatar (see [Client.DirectionalPad](/reference/client#property-directionalpad)). It's the reason why you can stop moving horizontally while in the air.

          Basically, `Motion` is an instantaneous displacement that contributes to moving [This] every frame, without changing [This].[Velocity](#property-velocity) directly.

          `Motion` is expressed in world coordinates per second.

          ⚠️ `Motion` will only affect [This]'s position while [This].[Physics](#property-physics) is `true`. Whenever it is set to `false`, `Motion` is set to `{0,0,0}`.
      samples:
        - code: |
            local speed = 10
            myObject.Motion = Camera.Forward * speed
            -- myObject will move in the same direction the camera is currently facing.
            -- If the Camera rotates after this, it won't change where myObject is heading.

    - name: "LocalScale"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Scale of the [Object], in its parent.

          Nested [Object] local scales are combined to obtain the "world scale" ([Object.LossyScale](#property-lossyscale)), the [Object]'s final scale.
      samples:
        - code: |
            myObject.LocalScale = 2 -- the Object is now 2 times bigger
        - code: |
            topLevelObject.LocalScale = 2
            local o = Object()
            o.LocalScale = 0.5
            topLevelObject:AddChild(o) -- o becomes a child of topLevelObject
            -- o ends up being displayed with a scale of 1

    - name: "LossyScale"
      read-only: true
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Convenience property that attempts to match the actual world scale as much as it can. Note that [Object]s that have multiple levels of nested rotations and scales will return a skewed lossy scale.

    - name: Mass
      type: "number"
      description: |
          The mass of the [Object] determines how much a given force can move it and whether or not another object can be pushed by it. It cannot be zero, a neutral mass is a mass of 1.

    - name: Friction
      type: "number"
      description: |
          The combined friction of 2 [Object]s in contact represents how much the moving [Object] will be able to slide along the colliding [Object]. It is a rate between 0 (full stop on contact) and 1 (full slide, no friction), values higher than 1 are allowed and will create an increasing momentum, like sliding on ice.

    - name: Bounciness
      type: "number"
      description: |
          The combined bounciness of 2 [Object]s in contact represents how much of the moving [Object]'s velocity is produced after being in contact with colliding [Object], it is a rate between 0 (no bounce) and 1 (100% of the velocity bounced). Values higher than 1 are allowed and will create an increasing momentum at each bounce (try at your own risk).

    - name: CollisionBox
      type: "Box"
      description: |
          All [Object]s have a collision box that represents the space occupied in the scene with regards to collisions. For [Shape]s and [Player]s, the collision box is updated with their bounding box. For [Object]s, it is a 1-cube by default after physics was enabled for the first time.

    - name: "ChildrenCount"
      read-only: true
      type: "integer"
      description: |
          Returns number of child [Object]s.

    - name: "Up"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Up` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "up" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].

    - name: "Right"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Right` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "right" for the [This].

      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Forward` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "forward" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].

    - name: "Left"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Left` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "left" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].

    - name: "Down"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Down` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "down" for the [This].

          Setting it is a way to rotate the [This].

    - name: "Backward"
      type: "Number3"
      description: |
          `Backward` is a unit vector (vector with a length of 1). It determines which direction is "backward" for the [This].
