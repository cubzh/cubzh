extends: "Object"
description: |
    A `Quad` is an object which model has four vertices, forming a square. It can be filled with a color or an image.

    It has many uses in creating UI, building a 2D world, or creating special effects.

    Code examples of [This]'s features can be found in the following worlds,
    - `Quad Image Test`
    - `Quad 9-Slice Test`
    - `Quad Cutout Test`
    - `Quad Gradient Test`
    - `Quad Transparency Test`

constructors: 
  - description: "Creates a Quad with default properties."
    samples:
      - code: |
          local q = Quad()

          -- set quad properties
          q.Height = 2
          q.Color = Color(1.0, 1.0, 0.5)

          -- use it as a normal object in the scene
          q:SetParent(World)
          q.Position = { x, y, z }

properties:
    - name: "Color"
      type: "Color"
      description: |
          Color of the quad, white by default. The color of each of the four vertices can also be set individually by passing a table of up to four colors.

          [This].[Color] also features a helper to set up gradients: { gradient="H"/"V" or "X"/"Y", from=color1, to=color2 }.
          
          It also gives the option to opt-in to alpha-blending, instead of the default unordered transparency. Opt-in by adding the option: { ..., alpha=true }. Using this option turns OFF some optimizations and is generally slower than default transparency, but more accurate.

          An example of quad gradients can be seen in the world `Quad Gradient Test`.
      
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- quad color accepts a table of up to four colors
            q.Color = { vcolor1, vcolor2, vcolor3, vcolor4 }

            -- this sets all colors at once
            q.Color = Color.Blue

            -- use helper for a horizontal gradient
            q.Color = { gradient="H", from=Color.Blue, to=Color.Red }

            -- make the quad use default transparency if any given color has alpha < 255
            local c = Color(255, 0, 0, 120)
            q.Color = c
            q.Color = { vcolor1, vcolor2, vcolor3, c }

            -- opt-in to alpha-blending, instead of default transparency, gives more accurate results but is slower
            q.Color = { c, alpha=true }
            q.Color = { vcolor1, vcolor2, vcolor3, c, alpha=true }

    - name: "Image"
      type: "Data"
      description: |
          Assign with a compatible image [Data](reference/data) to display it on the quad, with default settings. Set it to `false` or `nil` to clear it.
        
          When getting this value, it returns `true` if the quad is currently textured.

          Alternatively, you can assign a table to have full control over its options: `{ data, 9slice, 9sliceScale, alpha, cutout }`,
          - `data` ([Data](reference/data)) is the image data you would normally set.
          - `9slice` ([boolean](reference/boolean) or [Number2](reference/number2)) can be set to `true` to activate 9-slice with default UV slice (0.5, 0.5), it can also be set to a custom UV slice directly.
          - `9sliceScale` ([number](reference/number)) is the scale of the 9-slice corners. It can be relevant to use points scaling here, with [Screen](reference/screen).[Density](reference/screen#property-density).
          - `alpha` ([boolean](reference/boolean)) enables alpha-blending transparency, default `false`. Set this to `true` if you want Cubzh to use the image alpha.
          - `cutout` ([boolean](reference/boolean) or [number](reference/number)) can be set to `true` to enable alpha cutout with default alpha `0.0`, or set to a custom cutout directly. This means all texels from the image with alpha value lower or equal to the cutout value will be ignored. This value is typically redundant with `alpha`, and unless you have a specific use-case in mind, you should use one or the other. Animating the cutout value is a great way of creating interesting visual effects.

          Note: you can also enable transparency on a textured quad by giving it an alpha value less than 255, eg. `quad.Color.A = 254`. This however will have it be rendered in an unordered transparency pass.

          Code examples of [This].[Image]'s options can be found in the following worlds,
          - `Quad Image Test`
          - `Quad 9-Slice Test`
          - `Quad Cutout Test`
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- make an alpha-blended textured quad
            q.Image = { data=d, alpha=true }

            -- enable 9-slice with default parameters
            q.Image = { data=d, slice9=true }

            -- enable 9-slice with custom UV slice, default slice is { 0.5, 0.5 }
            q.Image = { data=d, slice9={ 0.25, 0.5 } }

            -- enable 9-slice with custom borders scale, default is 1.0
            q.Image = { data=d, slice9Scale=2.0 }

            -- can be combined
            q.Image = { data=d, slice9={ 0.6, 0.0 }, slice9Scale=0.8, alpha=true }

            -- make an opaque cutout quad with default value
            q.Image = { data=d, cutout=true }

            -- make an opaque cutout quad with custom value
            q.Image = { data=d, cutout=0.2 }

    - name: "Width"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Width of the quad model, `1.0` by default.

    - name: "Height"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Height of the quad model, `1.0` by default.
    
    - name: "Size"
      type: "Number2"
      description: "Returns the size of the quad model. Equivalent to `Number2(quad.Width, quad.Height)`."

    - name: "Anchor"
      type: "Number2"
      description: |
          Anchor of the quad, `{ 0.0, 0.0 }` by default, which corresponds to the lower left corner.
        
          For example, `{ 0.5, 0.0 }` would correspond to the middle of the bottom edge of the quad.

    - name: "Tiling"
      type: "Number2"
      description: |
          Tiling of the texture on this quad. Only has effect if the quad is textured by setting its [This].[Image](/reference/quad#property-image) property.
          
          This can be used to repeat a pattern over the quad's surface. Especially useful when combined with a seamless image, to create a continuously textured surface.

    - name: "Offset"
      type: "Number2"
      description: |
          Offset of the texture on this quad. Only has effect if the quad is textured by setting its [This].[Image](/reference/quad#property-image) property.
          
          This can be used to select an area of the texture to display, or to create scrolling effects.

    - name: "IsDoubleSided"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          If `true`, both sides of the quad are rendered, `true` by default.
        
          Setting this to `false` can be done as an optimization when using quads for UI or 2D games.

          Note: currently, quads back faces are not lit.

    - name: "Shadow"
      type: boolean
      description: |
          Whether or not the quad should cast shadows onto other lit objects. [Light](/reference/light) objects set as shadow casters will affect all quads in matching layers (see [Light](/reference/light).[CastsShadows](/reference/light#property-castsshadows)).

          Note that whether or not the quad is affected by lights and shadows from other objects depends on the separate property [This].[IsUnlit](/reference/quad#property-isunlit).

    - name: "Layers"
      type: "table"
      description: |
          Integer or table of integers between 1 and 12. Cameras only render quads corresponding to their layers, and lights only affect quads in matching layers.

    - name: "IsUnlit"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Whether or not the quad should ignore scene lighting, `false` by default. If `true`, the quad won't be affected by any light and shadows from other objects.
    
    - name: "IsMask"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Activates masking for this quad. Any children of a quad mask will only be visible within the quad's area on screen.

          Nested masks are supported to a maximum depth of 7. Up to 31 individual masks can be active at a time, nested masks do not count towards this limit.
