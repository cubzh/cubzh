type: "Quad"
extends: "Object"
description: |
    A `Quad` is an object which model has four vertices, forming a square. It can be filled with a color or an image.

    It has many uses in creating UI, building a 2D world, or creating special effects.

constructors: 
  - description: "Creates a Quad with default properties."
    samples:
      - code: |
          local q = Quad()

          -- set quad properties
          q.Height = 2
          q.Color = Color(1.0, 1.0, 0.5)

          -- use it as a normal object in the scene
          q:SetParent(World)
          q.Position = { x, y, z }

properties:
    - name: "Color"
      type: "Color"
      description: |
          Color of the quad, white by default.

    - name: "Image"
      type: "Data"
      description: |
          Assign with a compatible image `Data` to display it on the quad. Set it to `false` or `nil` to clear it.
        
          When getting this value, it returns `true` if the quad is currently textured.

          Note: currently, supporting transparency on a texture requires to flag the quad as transparent by giving it an alpha value less than 255, eg. `quad.Color.A = 254`.

    - name: "Width"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Width of the quad model, `1.0` by default.

    - name: "Height"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Height of the quad model, `1.0` by default.
    
    - name: "Size"
      type: "Number2"
      description: "Returns the size of the quad model. Equivalent to `Number2(quad.Width, quad.Height)`."

    - name: "Anchor"
      type: "Number2"
      description: |
          Anchor of the quad, `{ 0.0, 0.0 }` by default, which corresponds to the lower left corner.
        
          For example, `{ 0.5, 0.0 }` would correspond to the middle of the bottom edge of the quad.

    - name: "Tiling"
      type: "Number2"
      description: |
          Tiling of the texture on this quad. Only has effect if the quad is textured by setting its [Image](/reference/quad#property-image) property.
          
          This can be used to repeat a pattern over the quad's surface. Especially useful when combined with a seamless image, to create a continuously textured surface.

    - name: "Offset"
      type: "Number2"
      description: |
          Offset of the texture on this quad. Only has effect if the quad is textured by setting its [Image](/reference/quad#property-image) property.
          
          This can be used to select an area of the texture to display, or to create scrolling effects.

    - name: "IsDoubleSided"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          If `true`, both sides of the quad are rendered, `true` by default.
        
          Setting this to `false` can be done as an optimization when using quads for UI or 2D games.

          Note: currently, quads back faces are not lit.

    - name: "Shadow"
      type: boolean
      description: |
          Whether or not the quad should be affected by light shadow casters in matching layers.

    - name: "Layers"
      type: "table"
      description: |
          Integer or table of integers between 1 and 12. Cameras only render quads corresponding to their layers, and lights only affect quads in matching layers.

    - name: "IsUnlit"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Whether or not the [This] should ignore scene lighting, `false` by default.
    
    - name: "IsMask"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Activates masking for this quad. Any children of a quad mask will only be visible within the quad's area on screen.

          Nested masks are supported to a maximum depth of 7. Up to 31 individual masks can be active at a time, nested masks do not count towards this limit.
