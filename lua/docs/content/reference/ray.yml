      A ray has one origin point in the 3D scene and a direction. It returns potentials [Impact]s and the distance from the origin when that happens.

constructors:

      arguments:
      - name: "origin"
        type: "Number3"

      description: |
          Casts a ray and returns an [Impact] that contains information about what's been hit. If nothing was it, returns `nil` instead.

          The ray will intersect with any objects matching the `filterIn` collision groups. If `nil` is provided, the ray collides with all [CollisionGroups] by default.
          Alternatively, the `filterIn` parameter can be a [Shape], in which case the raycast will only be performed against the shape's blocks.

          Additionally, an object can be provided as `filterOut` to exclude it as a potential result. However, it is generally a best practice to filter using collision groups.
      
          The third parameter `onlyFirstImpact` dictates whether or not to receive only the first impacted object, or all of the intersected objects in a table. It is set to `true` by default.

          [nil] by default. Can be set to an [Object] to filter it out from possible collisions.
