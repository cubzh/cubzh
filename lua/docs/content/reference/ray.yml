      A ray has one origin point in the 3D scene and a direction. It returns potentials [Impact]s and the distance from the origin when that happens.

      description: |
          Casts a ray and returns an [Impact] (can be [nil]).

          The [Impact] contains information about what's been hit.

          By default, a ray collides with all [CollisionGroups]. But filters can be set, if you want your ray to only collide with the [Map] for example. You can also filter out an [Object] of any kind.

          Defines items colliding with the ray. [nil] by default, meaning the ray collides with everything.

      types:
        - "nil"
        - "Object"
      description: |
          [nil] by default. Can be set to an [Object] to filter it out from possible collisions.
