      A table is a basic Lua type, it implements associative arrays.

      An associative array is an array that can be indexed not only with [number]s, but also with [string]s or any other value of the language, except [nil].

  - code: |
      local t = {} -- create an empty table

      t["x"] = 10 -- set value == 10 for "x" key
      t.x = 10 -- does the exact same thing

      -- ⚠️ --
      local x = "aKey"
      t[x] = 10 -- this sets a value for the "aKey" key

     A table may store values with different types of indices and it grows as it needs to accommodate new entries:

  - code: |
      local t = {} 
      t.foo = "bar"
      t[2] = 10
      t["test"] = true

      -- go through all key/value pairs of t
      for key, value in pairs(t) do
        print(key, value)
      end
      -- prints "foo bar", "2 10", "test true" in an unspecified order

      A table can be initialized with values:

  - code: |
      local days = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday",
      "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}
      -- days[1] == "Sunday"
      -- days[2] == "Monday"
      -- ...

      local position = {x=1, y=2}
      -- position.x == 1
      -- position.y == 2
