    An `AudioSource` is a component you can attach to an object in your scene to play back a sound in your world. It allows you to pick one of the built-in Cubzh sound files and play it with or without spatialization.

    Each `AudioSource` can play one and only one audio file at a time. Moreover, every source can be spatialized or not (note that it is by default), meaning that it can be either a 3D or a 2D sound source. So, when it is spatialized, an `AudioSource` will sound differently depending on where it is relative to the [`AudioListener`](/reference/audiolistener) in the game.

    ⚠️ The full list of built-in sounds is available in the [Adding sounds to your game](/guides/quick/adding-sounds.yml) quick guide.
constructors: 
  - description: "Creates an AudioSource. If a sound name is provided, the AudioSource is initialized with the sound."
    samples:
      - code: |
          -- creates a sound source using the
          -- "gun_shot_1" sound file reference
          local as = AudioSource("gun_shot_1")
      - code: |
          -- creates a sound source using the
          -- "gun_shot_1" sound file reference
          local as = AudioSource()
          as.Sound = "gun_shot_1"

properties:
    - name: "Pan"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          `AudioSource`'s left/right pan (from `-1.0`: full left ear, to `1.0`: full right ear, with a default of `0.0`: both ears at equal volume).

          ⚠️ This has no effect if the source is spatialized.
      samples:
          - code: |
              local as = AudioSource()
              as.Sound = "big_explosion_1"
              as.Pan = 0.2 -- "move the sound" slightly to the right
    - name: "Pitch"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          `AudioSource`'s pitch (`1.0` by default). If you set it to a number above `1.0`, then the frequency of the sound will be increased and it will sound "higher"; else if you set it to a number below `1.0`, the frequency will be reduced and the sound will be "lower". The pitch cannot be `0.0`, but it can technically go up to `+infinity`.
      samples:
          - code: |
              local as = AudioSource()
              as.Sound = "big_explosion_3"
              as.Pitch = 1.2 -- pitch the sound up
    - name: "Sound"
      type: "string"
      description: |
          `AudioSource`'s sound file reference. It must be in the list of available built-in sounds.
      samples:
          - code: |
              local as = AudioSource()
              as.Sound = "rain_1"
    - name: "Spatialized"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Whether the `AudioSource` uses spatialization or not (`true` by default).
      samples:
          - code: |
              local as = AudioSource()
              as.Sound = "drinking_1"
              as.Spatialized = false
    - name: "StartAt"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          `AudioSource`'s start time (in seconds).
      samples:
          - code: |
              local as = AudioSource()
              as.Sound = "wood_impact_1"
              as.StartAt = 0.2
    - name: "StopAt"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          `AudioSource`'s end time (in seconds).
      samples:
          - code: |
              local as = AudioSource()
              as.Sound = "gun_reload_1"
              as.StopAt = 0.8
    - name: "Volume"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          `AudioSource`'s volume (from `0.0`: no sound, to `1.0`: full sound).
      samples:
          - code: |
              local as = AudioSource()
              as.Sound = "metal_clanging_1"
              as.Volume = 0.8

    - name: "Length"
      type: "number"
      read-only: true
      description: |
          Length of the original sound in seconds. It does not take into account [Pitch], [StartAt] or [StopAt].

    - name: "Loop"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Automatically restart the `AudioSource` playback at the end of this one.
      samples:
          - code: |
              as = AudioSource()
              as.Sound = "drinking_1"
              as.Loop = true
              as:Play()

    - name: "IsPlaying"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Returns `true` if the audio source is currently playing a sound.

functions:
    - name: "Pause"
      description: |
          Temporarily interrupts the `AudioSource` playback, while keeping track of the current playback time. If you call [`Play`](#functions-play) afterwards, the sound will resume where it was stopped.

    - name: "Play"
      description: |
          Starts the `AudioSource` playback.

          If you want to play a sound that has already been played, you must use 2 AudioSources to avoid having a blank between the playbacks.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.Action2 = function()
              if a1 == nil then
                a1 = AudioSource("gun_reload_1")
                a1:Play()
                a2 = nil -- stops the playback
              else
                a2 = AudioSource("gun_reload_1")
                a2:Play()
                a1 = nil
              end
            end

    - name: "Stop"
      description: |
          Stops the `AudioSource` playback and resets the current playback time. If you call [`Play`](#functions-play) afterwards, the sound will restart from the beginning of the audio clip.
