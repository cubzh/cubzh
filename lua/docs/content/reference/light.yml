type: "Light"
extends: "Object"

    A `Light` is an object that can be placed in the scene to act as a light source.

    There are currently 3 types of light: point, spot, and directional.

    A code example of `Light`'s various fields can be found in the world `Lights Tests`.

    ⚠️ Currently, only directional lights ([Type](/reference/light#property-type)) have shadow-casting capability.

constructors: 
  - description: "Creates a Light with default properties."
    samples:
      - code: |
          local l = Light()

          -- change light properties
          l.Radius = 50
          l.Color = Color(1.0, 1.0, 0.5)

          -- use it as a normal object in the scene
          l:SetParent(World)
          l.Position = { x, y, z }

properties:
    - name: "Type"
      type: "LightType"
      description: |
          The light type can be one of `LightType.Point` (by default), `LightType.Spot`, or `LightType.Directional`.

          Note that it can be changed at any time.

    - name: "Color"
      type: "Color"
      description: |
          Color of the light, white by default.

    - name: "Range"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Range of the light, `30` by default. Has no effect for directional lights.

    - name: "Radius"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Radius of a point light. Alias to [This].[Range] for convenience.

    - name: "Hardness"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          The hardness of a light source represents the core intensity of the emitted light.

          At the minimum value of `0`, the lit area will appear diffuse with smooth edges. At its maximum value of `1`, it will appear bright with clear sharp edges.

          Default hardness is `0.5`.

    - name: "Angle"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Angle of the cone of a spot light, default is `0.7` radians. Has no effect on other light types.

    - name: "Intensity"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Intensity of the light, default is `1.8`. A value between `0.0` and `1.0` dims illumination of the scene, whereas values higher than `1.0` adds light color over the scene.

          This can be set on global `Light` object to control all lights' intensity at once, or on a light instance to override its individual intensity.

    - name: "Ambient"
      type: "Ambient"
      description: |
          A collection of general lighting and color properties. This can only be accessed on global `Light` object.

    - name: "On"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Toggles the light source on and off.

    - name: "CastsShadows"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Enables the light source as a shadow caster. Cubzh may limit the number of light shadow casters in a scene based on each player's device.

          ⚠️ Currently, only directional lights ([Type](/reference/light#property-type)) have shadow-casting capability.

    - name: "PriorityGroup"
      type: "integer"
      description: |
          `PriorityGroup` is a way to create light groups in order of importance from `0` to `255` (default group).

          If your world is played on a mobile or lower-end device, the maximum number of simultaneaous lights on screen may vary based on hardware capabilities.

          If you want to ensure a smooth gameplay on your world for all users, a good practice is to prioritize all gameplay-essential lights.
          For example, if your game features a light torch that the player carries, you could place it in `PriorityGroup` `0` to ensure it is always rendered first and leave other lights that are part of the environment in a lower group.

          You can assign as many lights as you want per group, however only groups order is garanteed, lights within a given group are rendered unordered.

    - name: "Layers"
      type: "table"
      description: |
          Integer or table of integers between 1 and 12. The light will affect other objects in matching layers.
