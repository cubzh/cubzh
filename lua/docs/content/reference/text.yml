    A `Text` is an object with a text and optional background frame attached.
  
    It may be used in two different display modes by setting its [Text.Type](#property-type) field,
    - as a `TextType.World`, it will behave exactly like any other object in the scene, great for creating postsigns;
    - as a `TextType.Screen`, it will be displayed from its position in the scene always facing the camera, like an UI element - great for text bubbles.
  
    By default, a [This] is set to `TextType.World`.
  
    If you were using the deprecated `Object:TextBubble` and `Object:ClearTextBubble` functions prior to 0.0.48, you may use the "textbubble.lua" module. It contains the following functions which use [This] objects instead,
    - import the module with `tb = require("textbubble.lua")`
    - `tb.set(object, text, duration, offset, color, backgroundColor, tail)`
    - `tb.clear(object)`

    samples:
      - code: |
          local t = Text()

          -- change text properties
          t.Text = "Hello world!"
          t.Type = TextType.Screen
          t.IsUnlit = true
          t.Tail = true

          -- use it as a normal object in the scene
          t:SetParent(Player)
          t.LocalPosition = { 0, 34, 0 }

properties:
    - name: "Type"
      type: "TextType"
      description: |
          The text type can be set to `TextType.World` (default) or `TextType.Screen`.
        
          As a `TextType.World`, the text will be translated, rotated, and scaled like any other object in the scene, eg. a signpost.
          As a `TextType.Screen`, the text will be displayed in front of everything else, facing the camera from its position in the scene, eg. a text bubble above a player's head.
        
          Note that it can be changed at any time. Some [This] fields are automatically expressed in world units or points based on the text type.

    - name: "MaxDistance"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Maximum distance in world units beyond which the text will disappear, `350.0` by default.

      description: |
          Whether to display a tail under the background frame, like a text bubble, `false` by default.

    - name: "Width"
      type: "number"
      read-only: true
      description: |
          Width of the [This] in points. Expressed in world units if the text type is `TextType.World`.
        
          This accounts for the total size including background frame, padding, and tail.

    - name: "Height"
      type: "number"
      read-only: true
      description: |
          Height of the [This] in points. Expressed in world units if the text type is `TextType.World`.
        
          This accounts for the total size including background frame, padding, and tail.

    - name: "Padding"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Text padding over background in points, `8` by default. Expressed in world units if the text type is `TextType.World`.

    - name: "FontSize"
      type: "number"

          Font size in points, `22.0` by default. Expressed in world units if the text type is `TextType.World`.

    - name: "Layers"
      type: "table"
      description: |
          Integer or table of integers between 1 and 8. Cameras only render objects corresponding to their layers.

    - name: "MaxWidth"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Maximum width in points beyond which the text will automatically break line, `0` by default (disabled). Expressed in world units if the text type is `TextType.World`.

    - name: "IsUnlit"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Whether or not the [This] should ignore scene lighting, `false` by default.

    - name: "ScreenToWorldFactor"
      type: "number"
      description: |
        The factor applied to convert [This] fields from screen points to world units when swapping [Text.Type](#property-type).
        
        Note that this is not an instance field. It is accessible through [This] globally exposed variable: `Text.ScreenToWorldFactor`.
