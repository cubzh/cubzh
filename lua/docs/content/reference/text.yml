    A `Text` is an object with a text and optional background frame attached.
  
    It may be used in two different display modes by setting its [Text.Type](#property-type) field,
    - as a `TextType.World`, it will behave exactly like any other object in the scene, great for creating postsigns;
    - as a `TextType.Screen`, it will be displayed from its position in the scene always facing the camera, like an UI element - great for text bubbles.
  
    By default, a [This] is set to `TextType.World`.
  
    If you were using the deprecated `Object:TextBubble` and `Object:ClearTextBubble` functions prior to 0.0.48, you may use the "textbubble.lua" module. It contains the following functions which use [This] objects instead,
    - import the module with `tb = require("textbubble.lua")`
    - `tb.set(object, text, duration, offset, color, backgroundColor, tail)`
    - `tb.clear(object)`

    samples:
      - code: |
          local t = Text()

          -- change text properties
          t.Text = "Hello world!"
          t.Type = TextType.Screen
          t.IsUnlit = true
          t.Tail = true

          -- use it as a normal object in the scene
          t:SetParent(Player)
          t.LocalPosition = { 0, 34, 0 }

properties:
    - name: "Type"
      type: "TextType"
      description: |
          The text type can be set to `TextType.World` (default) or `TextType.Screen`.
        
          As a `TextType.World`, the text will be translated, rotated, and scaled like any other object in the scene, eg. a signpost.
          As a `TextType.Screen`, the text will be displayed in front of everything else, facing the camera from its position in the scene, eg. a text bubble above a player's head.
        
          Note that it can be changed at any time. Some [This] fields are then expressed in world units or points based on the text type.

    - name: "Width"
      type: "number"
      read-only: true
      description: |
          Width of the [This] with points scaling. Use this value if the text type is `TextType.Screen`, or if you are scaling your scene using [Screen](reference/screen).[Width](reference/screen#property-width) and [Screen](reference/screen).[Height](reference/screen#property-height) points values.
        
          This accounts for the total size including background frame, padding, and tail.

          This accounts for the total size including background frame, padding, and tail.

          Built-in font point sizes can be accessed by setting the following strings: "default", "small", or "big". These sizes are internally calculated based on screen density, and can be used to maximize readability accross devices.

    - name: "Layers"
      type: "table"
      description: |
          Integer or table of integers between 1 and 12. Cameras only render objects corresponding to their layers.

    - name: "Font"
      type: "Font"
      description: |
          The font used by [This]'s text message. It can be one of the following,
          - `Font.Pixel`: a pixel font which generally scales well whatever the size. It is lit by [Shape](reference/shape)'s baked lighting, and can be lit by [Light](reference/light) objects if the text's color is opaque. Internally, transparent texts using this font are rendered within an order-independant pass.
          - `Font.Noto`: a vector font which will look smoother, but may not always scale well when displaying extremely big texts. It is lit by [Shape](reference/shape)'s baked lighting, but not by [Light](reference/light) objects. Internally, transparent texts using this font are rendered in an alpha-blending pass.

    - name: "IsDoubleSided"
      type: "boolean"
