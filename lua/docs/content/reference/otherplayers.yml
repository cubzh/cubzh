  - text: |
      [OtherPlayers] is a table containing all [Player]s except the local one.
    
      [OtherPlayers] is not available to the [Server], because it just wouldn't make sense! 🙂

      [Player]s are indexed by their "player ID". Player IDs range from 0 to 15.

      ⚠️ Don't use `ipairs` for iterating over `OtherPlayers`, but only `pairs`.
  - code: |
      for id, player in pairs(OtherPlayers) do
        -- id and player.ID have the same value here
        print(id, player.ID, player.Username)
      end
