      Items is a shortcut to [Config].Items.

      It's basically an [array] of of [string]s, indexed in different ways once items are loaded.

      Items can be used to instanciate [Shape]s and [MutableShape]s.

      An item is always identified by its repository and its name: `repo_name.item_name`.

      The repository name usually corresponds to the author's username.

      NOTE: The repository name can be ommited for official items: `Items.official.sword == Items.sword`.

      Config = {
        Items = {"aduermael.pumpkin", "aduermael.tomato"}
      }
      -- also works this way:
      Config.Items = {"aduermael.pumpkin", "aduermael.tomato"}
      -- or 
      Items = {"aduermael.pumpkin", "aduermael.tomato"}

      Once the game is loaded (after [Client].[OnStart](/reference/client#property-onstart) has been called), [Items] can be used to instanciate [Shape]s or [MutableShape]s:

  - code: |
      local s = Shape(Items.aduermael.pumpkin)
      -- or
      local s = Shape(Items["aduermael.pumpkin"])
      -- or even this way, if you know the index:
      local s = Shape(Items[1])
