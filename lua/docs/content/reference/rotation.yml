type: "Rotation"
description: |
    A [Rotation] is a transformation that can be applied to an `Object`, a `Number3` or another `Rotation`.
    
    It can be created from euler angles, an axis-angle, or from vectors, and can be used as a safe way to store, manipulate, and apply rotations in your scene.

    A table of three numbers can be used in place of an expected [Rotation] argument in all of its functions and most operations.

    Internally, a quaternion is used to represent a [Rotation]. All of its functions as well as the `*` operator use this form. It allows rotations to be applied in a scene of any complexity.
    However, the `+` and `-` operators are performed on the euler angles form, which may be used on simpler use-cases.

    You can access the euler representation at any time using [Rotation].[X](#property-x), [Rotation].[Y](#property-y) and [Rotation].[Z](#property-z).
    Note that the euler angles may change despite representing the same rotation, that is because there are several sequences of X, Y, Z rotations leading to the same transformation. This can also be due to euler angles being snapped back into the range 0 to 2PI.

    ⚠️ If you are having issues with rotations in your scene, try to avoid performing calculations using euler angles and instead,
    - to safely combine rotations, use the `*` operator instead of the `+` / `-` euler operators,
        - `rotA + rotB` can be replaced by `rotB * rotA`
        - `rotA - rotB` can be replaced by `-rotB * rotA`
    - leverage the built-in [Rotation] alternate set functions,
      [rotation:SetAxisAngle](/reference/rotation#functions-setaxisangle)
      [rotation:SetLookRotation](/reference/rotation#functions-setlookrotation)
      [rotation:SetFromToRotation](/reference/rotation#functions-setfromtorotation)
    - leverage the built-in [Object] rotate functions,
      [object:RotateLocal](/reference/object#functions-rotatelocal)
      [object:RotateWorld](/reference/object#functions-rotateworld)
      [object:RotationLocalToWorld](/reference/object#functions-rotationlocaltoworld)
      [object:RotationWorldToLocal](/reference/object#functions-rotationworldtolocal)
    - leverage the built-in [Number3] rotate function,
      [number3:Rotate](/reference/number3#functions-rotate)

constructors: 
  - description: |
        A rotation can be created,
        - without parameter, rotation will be identity
        - with euler angles
        - with axis-angle

        Either way, a quaternion is created and used internally to safely represent that rotation.

functions:
  - name: "Copy"
    return: 
        - type: "Rotation" 
    description: |
        Returns a new [Rotation] as a copy of this rotation.
          
  - name: "Inverse"
    description: |
        Inverse the rotation. This is safer than negating euler angles.
        
        Note that negating a [Rotation] by writing `-myRot` is performing the inverse and returning it.

  - name: "Lerp"
    description: |
        Sets this `Rotation` to the linear interpolation between two given rotations at a given ratio.

        This is faster than Slerp, but may not always be appropriate. Use Slerp instead if Lerp doesn't give satisfactory results.
