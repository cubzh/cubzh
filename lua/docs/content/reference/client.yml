type: "Client"
description: |
    Client is storing variables and running functions on all connected user devices (clients). It contains everything needed for the local simulation.

    Client is nil in the [Server] execution context.

functions:
    - name: "OpenChatInput"
      description: |
        Opens the chat input.

    - name: "OpenGameMenu"
      description: |
        Shows the game menu.

        From there, players can exit or resume the game.


properties:

    - name: "DidReceiveEvent"
      type: "function"
      description: |
        This function is triggered when receiving an [Event].

        Events are useful to establish communication between the [Server] and all connected [Player]s.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.DidReceiveEvent = function(event)
              -- do something with the event

              -- respond (if it makes sense in the situation)
              local response = Event()
              response.content = "Here's my response!"
              response:SendTo(event.Sender)
            end

              print("action1 released")
            end

      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.Action3 = function()

    - name: "DirectionalPad"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when what we call the "directional pad" or "D-pad" is activated. 

          The D-pad maps to the direction keys when using a keyboard (WASD by default).

          When using a touch screen, the D-pad is by default represented by the virtual pad that's on the left side of the screen.

          The function receives 2 arguments `x` & `y` to represent 8 possible directions or the idle state:

          `0,0 -> IDLE`
          `0,1 -> UP`, `1,0 -> RIGHT`, `0,-1 -> DOWN`, `-1,0 -> LEFT`
          `√2,√2 -> UP/RIGHT`, `√2,-√2 -> DOWN/RIGHT`, `-√2,-√2 -> DOWN/LEFT`, `-√2,√2 -> UP/LEFT`

          The norm (or length) of the (x,y) vector is always `1.0`, or `0.0` when idle.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATION
            -- (those functions can be redefined)

            Client.DirectionalPad = function(x, y)
                -- storing globals here for AnalogPad
                -- to update Player.Motion
                dpadX = x dpadY = y
                Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * y + Player.Right * x) * 50
            end

            Client.AnalogPad = function(dx, dy)
                Player.LocalRotation.Y = Player.LocalRotation.Y + dx * 0.01
                Player.LocalRotation.X = Player.LocalRotation.X + -dy * 0.01

                if dpadX ~= nil and dpadY ~= nil then
                    Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * dpadY + Player.Right * dpadX) * 50
                end
            end

    - name: "AnalogPad"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when what we call the "analog pad" or "A-pad" is activated. 

          The A-pad maps to the mouse mouvements when using a mouse.

          When using a touch screen, the A-pad is activated when moving the finger after a touch down from anywhere outside the [DirectionalPad](/reference/client#property-directionalpad).

          The function receives 2 arguments `dx` & `dy` to represent the delta compared to the previous position. When both `dx` & `dy` are equal to `0.0`, it means the pad is back to idle state.

      samples:
        - code: |
            -- DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATION

            Client.AnalogPad = function(dx, dy)
                Player.LocalRotation.Y = Player.LocalRotation.Y + dx * 0.01
                Player.LocalRotation.X = Player.LocalRotation.X + -dy * 0.01

                if dpadX ~= nil and dpadY ~= nil then
                    Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * dpadY + Player.Right * dpadX) * 50
                end

                dpadX = x dpadY = y
                Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * y + Player.Right * x) * 50

    - name: "OnChat"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when a message is submitted through the chat input. Receives the message ([string]) in parameter.

          In the default implementation, messages aren't sent to other connected users.
          But it's easy to do using [Event] and [Client.DidReceiveEvent](/reference/client#property-didreceiveevent).
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- the default implementation does this:
            Client.OnChat = function(message)
                print(Player.Username .. ": " .. message)
                Player:TextBubble(message, 3, true)
            end

    - name: "OnPlayerJoin"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when a player joins the game.

          It doens't mean the [Player] has spawned, just that there's a new connection.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.OnPlayerJoin = function(player)
              print(player.Username .. " joined the game!")
            end

    - name: "OnPlayerLeave"

      description: |
          Triggered when a player leaves the game.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.OnPlayerLeave = function(player)
              print("So long " .. player.Username .. "!")
            end

    - name: "OnStart"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when the game starts.

          This is the very first Lua function to be called, a good place to initialize variables.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.OnStart = function()
              -- add local Player to the World and place it above the center of the map
              World:AddChild(Player)
              Player.Position = {Map.Width / 2, Map.Height + 10, Map.Depth / 2}
            end

          Executed ~30 times per second. Provides the elapsed time in seconds as parameter.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- executed ~30 times per second on each user device
            Client.Tick = function(dt)
              print("elapsed:", dt, "seconds")

      type: "function"
      description: |
        This function is triggered when the user is about to open the menu that offers to resume or leave the experience.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.WillOpenGameMenu = function()
              -- possible things to do:
              -- - save user data
              -- - inform other users
              -- - if in a chat experience, set status as "away from keyboard" or something
            end
