    Client is storing variables and running functions on all connected user devices (clients). It contains everything needed for the local simulation.

    Client is nil in the [Server] execution context.

    - name: "DidReceiveEvent"
      type: "function"
      description: |
        This function is triggered when receiving an [Event].

        Events are useful to establish communication between the [Server] and all connected [Player]s.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.DidReceiveEvent = function(event)
              -- do something with the event

              -- respond (if it makes sense in the situation)
              local response = Event()
              response.content = "Here's my response!"
              response:SendTo(event.Sender)
            end

    - name: "Action1"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when pressing action 1 button. (space bar by default with a keyboard)
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.Action1 = function()
              print("action1")
            end

    - name: "Action1Release"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when releasing action 1 button. (space bar by default with a keyboard)
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.Action1Release = function()
              print("action1 released")
            end

    - name: "Action2"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when pressing action 2 button. (left click by default when using a mouse)

          (turned off when [Pointer] is hidden)
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.Action2 = function()
              print("action2")
            end
            
    - name: "Action2Release"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when releasing action 2 button. (left click by default when using a mouse)

          (turned off when [Pointer] is hidden)
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.Action2Release = function()
              print("action2 released")
            end

    - name: "Action3"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when pressing action 3 button. (right click by default when using a mouse)

          (turned off when [Pointer] is hidden)
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.Action3 = function()
              print("action3")
            end
            
    - name: "Action3Release"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when releasing action 3 button. (right click by default when using a mouse)

          (turned off when [Pointer] is hidden)
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.Action3Release = function()
              print("action3 released")

    - name: "Camera"
      type: "Camera"
      description: "See [Camera]."

    - name: "Clouds"
      type: "Clouds"
      description: "See [Clouds]."

    - name: "DirectionalPad"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when the "directional pad" changes direction.

          The "directional pad" maps to the direction keys when using a keyboard (WASD by default). When using a touch screen, it is by default represented by a virtual pad on the left side of the screen.

          The function is called only when the x or y value changes, not continuously while holding a direction.

          The function receives 2 arguments `x` & `y` to represent 8 possible directions and idle state:

          `0,0 -> IDLE`
          `0,1 -> UP`, `1,0 -> RIGHT`, `0,-1 -> DOWN`, `-1,0 -> LEFT`
          `√2,√2 -> UP/RIGHT`, `√2,-√2 -> DOWN/RIGHT`, `-√2,-√2 -> DOWN/LEFT`, `-√2,√2 -> UP/LEFT`

          The norm (or length) of the (x,y) vector is always `1.0`, or `0.0` when idle.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATION
            -- (these functions can be redefined)

            Client.DirectionalPad = function(x, y)
                Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * y + Player.Right * x) * 50
            end
            
            Client.AnalogPad = function(dx, dy)
                Player.LocalRotation = Rotation(0, dx * 0.01, 0) * Player.LocalRotation
                Player.Head.LocalRotation = Rotation(-dy * 0.01, 0, 0) * Player.Head.LocalRotation

                local dpad = require("controls").DirectionalPadValues
                Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * dpad.Y + Player.Right * dpad.X) * 50
            end

    - name: "AnalogPad"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when the "analog pad" changes position.

          The "analog pad" maps to the mouse movements when using a mouse. When using a touch screen, it is activated when moving the finger after a touch down that isn't caught by any other screen component (like [DirectionalPad](/reference/client#property-directionalpad)).

          The function is called only when the dx or dy value changes, not continuously while moving in a direction.

          The function receives 2 arguments `dx` & `dy` to represent the delta compared to the previous position. When both `dx` & `dy` are equal to `0.0`, it means the pad is back to idle state.

          (turned off when [Pointer] is hidden)

      samples:
        - code: |
            -- DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATION
            -- (these functions can be redefined)

            Client.AnalogPad = function(dx, dy)
                Player.LocalRotation = Rotation(0, dx * 0.01, 0) * Player.LocalRotation
                Player.Head.LocalRotation = Rotation(-dy * 0.01, 0, 0) * Player.Head.LocalRotation

                local dpad = require("controls").DirectionalPadValues
                Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * dpad.Y + Player.Right * dpad.X) * 50
            end

            Client.DirectionalPad = function(x, y)
                Player.Motion = (Player.Forward * y + Player.Right * x) * 50
            end

    - name: "OnChat"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when a message is submitted through the chat input. Receives the message ([string]) in parameter.

          In the default implementation, messages aren't sent to other connected users.
          But it's easy to do using [Event] and [Client.DidReceiveEvent](/reference/client#property-didreceiveevent).
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- the default implementation does this:
            Client.OnChat = function(payload)
                local message = payload.message -- accessing the message value from the payload table param
                print(Player.Username .. ": " .. message)
                Player:TextBubble(message, 3, true)
            end

    - name: "OnPlayerJoin"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when a player joins the game.

          It doesn't mean the [Player] has spawned, just that there's a new connection.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.OnPlayerJoin = function(player)
              print(player.Username .. " joined the game!")
            end

    - name: "OnPlayerLeave"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when a player leaves the game.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.OnPlayerLeave = function(player)
              print("So long " .. player.Username .. "!")
            end

    - name: "OnStart"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Triggered when the game starts.

          This is the very first Lua function to be called, a good place to initialize variables.
      samples:
        - code: |
            Client.OnStart = function()
              -- add local Player to the World and place it above the center of the map
              World:AddChild(Player)
              Player.Position = {Map.Width / 2, Map.Height + 10, Map.Depth / 2}
            end

    - name: "Tick"
      type: "function"
      description: |
          Executed ~30 times per second. Provides the elapsed time in seconds as parameter.
      samples:
        - code: |
            -- executed ~30 times per second on each user device
            Client.Tick = function(dt)
              print("elapsed:", dt, "seconds")
            end
